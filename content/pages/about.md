Welcome to my (very) little corner of the Internet.

I am Simon Guest, aka tesujimath, a veteran programmer of 30+ years, with experience in many and varied programming languages and technologies, and current particular interests in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Nix](https://nixos.org/), and [Elvish](https://elv.sh/).

I am unashamedly and exclusively a Linux guy, having started with Unix before Linux was even a thing.
